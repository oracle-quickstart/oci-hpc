Does your cluster run any file system like Ceph, NFS, etc. on the GPU/HPC nodes itself using local NVMe SSDs?  
If yes, terminating nodes which store your data can result in permanent data loss, so before proceeding make sure any important data is copied to a persistent file system outside of the cluster such as to object storage, file storage, etc.
Once data is backed up or migrated, come back and run the script. Select 2 to exit.
Remember, once the nodes are terminated, all the data is lost forever and you won't be able to recover it.
