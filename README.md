# Stack to create an HPC cluster. 

[![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-hpc/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)


## Policies to deploy the stack: 
```
allow service compute_management to use tag-namespace in tenancy
allow service compute_management to manage compute-management-family in tenancy
allow service compute_management to read app-catalog-listing in tenancy
allow group user to manage all-resources in compartment compartmentName
```

## What is cluster resizing (resize.py) ?

## What is cluster autoscaling ?

## How is resizing different from autoscaling ?

## Policies for autoscaling or resizing:
As described when you specify your variables, if you select instance-principal as way of authenticating your node, make sure your generate a dynamic group and give the following policies to it: 
```
Allow dynamic-group instance_principal to read app-catalog-listing in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group instance_principal to use tag-namespace in tenancy
```
And also either:

```
Allow dynamic-group instance_principal to manage compute-management-family in compartment compartmentName
Allow dynamic-group instance_principal to manage instance-family in compartment compartmentName
Allow dynamic-group instance_principal to use virtual-network-family in compartment compartmentName
```
or:

`Allow dynamic-group instance_principal to manage all-resources in compartment compartmentName`


# Resizing (via resize.py or OCI console)

# Autoscaling

The autoscaling will work in a “cluster per job” approach. This means that for job waiting in the queue, we will launch new cluster specifically for that job. Autoscaling will also take care of spinning down clusters. By default, a cluster is left Idle for 10 minutes before shutting down. Autoscaling is achieved with a cronjob to be able to quickly switch from one scheduler to the next. 

To turn on autoscaling: 
Uncomment the line in `crontab -e`:
```
* * * * * /home/opc/autoscaling/crontab/autoscale_slurm.sh >> /home/opc/autoscaling/logs/crontab_slurm.log 2>&1
```

# Submit
How to submit jobs: 
Slurm jobs can be submitted as always but a few more constraints can be set: 
Example in `autoscaling/submit/sleep.sbatch`: 

```
#!/bin/sh
#SBATCH -n 72
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node 36
#SBATCH --exclusive
#SBATCH --job-name sleep_job
#SBATCH --constraint cluster-size-2,BM.HPC2.36

cd /nfs/scratch
mkdir $SLURM_JOB_ID
cd $SLURM_JOB_ID
MACHINEFILE="hostfile"

# Generate Machinefile for mpi such that hosts are in the same
#  order as if run via srun
#
srun -N$SLURM_NNODES -n$SLURM_NNODES  hostname  > $MACHINEFILE
sed -i 's/$/:36/' $MACHINEFILE

cat $MACHINEFILE
# Run using generated Machine file:
sleep 1000
```

- cluster-size: Since clusters can be reused, you can decide to only use a cluster of exactly the right size. Created cluster will have a feature cluster-size-x. You can set the constraint cluster-size-x to make sure this matches and avoid having a 1 node job using a 16 nodes cluster. 

- shape: You can specify the OCI shape that you’d like to run on as a constraint. This will make sure that you run on the right shape and also generate the right cluster. Shapes are expected to be written in OCI format: BM.HPC2.36, BM.Standard.E3.128, BM.GPU4.8,… 
If you’d like to use flex shapes, you can use VM.Standard.E3.x with x the number of cores that you would like. 

## Clusters folders: 
```
~/autoscaling/clusters/clustername
```

## Logs: 
```
~/autoscaling/logs
```

Each cluster will have his own log with name: `create_clustername_date.log` and `delete_clustername_date.log`
The log of the crontab will be in `crontab_slurm.log`


## Manual clusters: 
You can create and delete your clusters manually. 
### Cluster Creation
```
/home/opc/autoscaling/create_cluster.sh NodeNumber clustername shape Cluster-network-enabled
```
Example: 
```
/home/opc/autoscaling/create_cluster.sh 4 cluster-6-amd3128 BM.Standard.E3.128 false
```

To be registered in slurm, the cluster names must be as such: 
BM.HPC2.36: cluster-i-hpc
BM.Standard2.52: cluster-i-std252
VM.Standard2.x: cluster-i-std2x
BM.Standard.E2.64: cluster-i-amd264
VM.Standard.E2.x: cluster-i-amd2x
BM.Standard.E3.128: cluster-i-amd3128
VM.Standard.E3.x: cluster-i-amd3x
BM.GPU2.2: cluster-i-gpu22
VM.GPU2.1: cluster-i-gpu21
BM.GPU3.8: cluster-i-gpu38
VM.GPU3.x: cluster-i-gpu3x
BM.GPU4.8: cluster-i-gpu48

### Cluster Deletion: 
```
/home/opc/autoscaling/create_cluster.sh clustername
```


## LDAP 
If selected bastion host will act as an LDAP server for the cluster. It's strongly recommended to leave default, shared home directory. 
User management can be performed from the bastion using ``` cluster ``` command.
